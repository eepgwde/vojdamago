The methods and analysis given in this project are more generally applicable.

Firstly, in asset management, it is the general case that there are assets that
need to be maintained with limited resources. Optimally scheduling maintenance
and major renewals of assets is an important part of business success.

This project has analysis that provides:

 - The overall maintenance load of the business is decided by environmental
   factors.
   
 - The prioritization of inspection, repairs and minor maintenance can be
   decided from fault histories.
   
 - The effective ages of assets can be estimated from asset histories.
 
Using machine learning technology, these three operational tools were developed:

 - A environmental predictor, see [KPI]({{ site.xbase }}/analyses/e2c/)
 
 - An Imputer for maintenance prioritization, 
 see [Predictor]({{ site.xbase }}/analyses/br/)
   
 - A Scheduler for asset renewal, see [MTBF]({{ site.xbase }}/analyses/a2d/)
