** Build

Packages for R 3.3.1 are listed in packages.lst

The source file out/xncas1.csv is available on SFTP

  make -f hcc5.mk S_FILE=/var/tmp/xncas1.csv all

It build a binary file for loading by the others, see hcc1.R

Then hcc3.R fits enquiries to weather

hcc4.R fits repudns to enqs and weather
hcc41.R fits repudns to enqrs and weather

hcc5.R fits repudns to claims

** hcc3.R

This predicts the enquiries with 90% accuracy from just the weather alone.

** hcc4a.R and friends

The KPI of repudns (risk of a claim).

hcc4.R can predict repudns from enqs with 0.95 accuracy.

shows that this is superior to enqrs with best of 0.91.
So not enough enqrs are addressing future claims.


shows that enq1s has 0.93 accuracy (so reported as CAT1) is nearly as
accurate as enqs

shows that enq2s also has 0.93 (so reported as CAT2) is nearly as
accurate as enqs as well.

enqr1s has 0.94 accuracy - nearly as high as enqs and higher than
enq1s.  So the high priority repairs are the right ones are being done
quickly.

enqr2s has only 0.91 accuracy, because this is lower than enqr1s and enq2s
is about the same as enqs1s, enq2rs are not being acted on quickly
enough or are not being actioned at all.
